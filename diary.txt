Activity: Reading Specification + Research on Git
Comments: Whilst also helping out with CSE hackathon, I spent this time reading through the specificaiton and getting familiar with git at every spare chance I got.

Activity: Coding
Comments: I decided to jump into coding before planning, which I kind of regretted but also didn't because it helped me get into the rhythm of things.
It did however took way too long to get init and add to be implemented without planning and just coding on the go. Although I have become more comfortable with the assignment by just diving into coding, I will spend tomorrow starting from planning!

Activity: Planning and implementing
Comments: I wrote down a good plan for Subset 0. And drew about my plan for each git command in subset 0 before attempting to implement this time around. (It was pretty much just pseudocode for each command) I managed to make my code much easier to understand for myselfand although I'm going through things relatively slowly, I want to keep at good commenting disciplines. I went through the lab08 snapshot perl program and have got my commit command semi-working. I'm dealing with a bug where commit is not being incremented above 1.

Activity: Debugging
Comments: I managed to figure out what was wrong with my commits not incrementing. Every time my program is run I need to load the last commit and to store that value I will have a file in legit rep called last_commit. The same will also go for the snapshot number.

Activity: Coding
Comments: Before moving onto log and show I was struggling with passing subset0_8. I realised the issue had to do with the way I was getting the file names in check files funciton. I had to chomp and concat accordingly. I figured it about by printing out what I thought i was passing as the file names. Once that was complete log was very easy to implement and what was left was show function and then subset0 would be complete. I had the flu during mid-sem so it whacked my time management plan and I don't think I'll pursue the other subsets in time before the busy week ahead.

Activity: Coding + Cleaning Up Code + Comment
Comments: After completing show which is the last funciton needed to be implemented in subset0, I had to then ensure all error messages were correct to the expected output and they were all printing to STDERR. I also took this time to clean up my code and flesh out my comments.

Activity: Test Suites Planning
Comments: Now that i've managed to pass all tests in autotest subset0, I had a quick brainstorm session and planned the tests suites I would do. This is what i had planned:
1. checks all usage error messages
2. big log
3. big show
4. normal
5. normal
6. file doesnt exist in index
7. file doesnt exist in snap but in index
9. file is different in index and snap
10. file is same in index and snap

Activity: Test Suites
Comments: Unfortunately one of the test suites I planned on didn't work out. I thought i could remove the files from snapshot folder but it doesn't seem to be allowed with the 2041 legit else I just couldnt figure it out. So I went for more straight forward test. Still was able to do about 90% of the tests I planned. It was hard to make 10 tests without it being something I've already tested since i only implemented up to subset0. I'm ready to submit since I don't have the time to do the others due to work commitments.
